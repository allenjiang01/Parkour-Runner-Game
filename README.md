# Game
 
## Proposal
The goal of this application is to create a simple 2D game where the user can
control a character on the screen to jump up and avoid obstacles. The game
will end once the user hits an obstacle. Scores will be kept tracked of and 
displayed. Inspirations are taken from the classic T-Rex run game.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to move my character up and down.
- As a user, I want to be able to see my score.
